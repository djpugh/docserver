Using Docserver
***************

Docserver is a simple webservice that serves static html generated through site generators like :mod:`sphinx`.

Each set of documentation can store multiple versions, including the latest version, and this can be accessed through the homepage.

As described in more detail in the `uploading documentation <uploading.html>`_, documentation can also be given different permissions
to limit access, so if you are unable to access documentation, please contact your admins.
